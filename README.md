# Portfolio

My portfolio is a show of my past works as a developer, written in HTML & using the CSS pre-processor SCSS.
Whilst on the _nology bootcamp, I worked on various personal projects such an Angular-based book API, a react-based filterable beer list (useful for me), a JavaScript Quiz, and a morse code translator (could be useful to someone, someday!).

### Tech

This site uses the following languages & principles:

  - HTML
  - JavaScript
  - SCSS / CSS
  - 7-1 SASS Architecture
  - Firebase Hosting

And of course my portfolio itself is open source, so feel free to pick and choose bits you like to host on your own GitHub!

### Todos
